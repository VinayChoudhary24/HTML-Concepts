    <h1>Span and Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>How are they different to a DIV(is also a Block Element) or BLOCk Element?</p>

    <!--Example with Div -->
    <!--When we use DIV in INLINE it takes the Text on to the NEXT Line because it Takes the FULL 100% WIDTH of the Page -->
    <p>I am DIV, The Color of Ketchup is <div>RED</div> Ok!!</p>

    <!--Example with Other Block Elements -->
    <!--When we use BLOCK in INLINE it takes the Text on to the NEXT Line because it Takes the FULL 100% WIDTH of the Page -->
    <p>I am Other Block Elements, The Color of Ketchup is <h1>RED</h1> Ok!!</p>

    <!--Example with SPAN -->
    <!--When we use SPAN INLINE it KEEPS the Text on the same Line because it Takes Small Portion and Does not Breaks to a new  line-->
    <p>i am SPAN, The Color of Ketchup is <span class="important">RED</span> OK!!</p>

    <!--TAGS that Work like SPAN:-
    1:- <strong>
    2:- <bold>
    3:- <i> -->
    <p>This is So <strong>COOL!!!</strong></p>
